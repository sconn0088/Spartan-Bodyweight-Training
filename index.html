			<h3>What is Spartan Bodyweight Training?</h3>
			<p>Bodyweight training are exercises that require you to manipulate
			your body weight throughout the exercises without the use of
			extra weights, like dumbbells or barbells, or machines. Examples
			include pushups and jumping jacks. Some	exercises, like dips and 
			pullups, use simple equipment.</p>
			<br>
			
			<h3>Bodyweight vs. Weight Training: Which is Right for You?</h3>
			<p>While bodyweight training is excellent for improving strength,
			balance, and flexibility, it won't be for everyone depending on your
			exercise goals. Here are the pros and cons for bodyweight training 
			and weight training:</p>
			<br>
			
			<section class="col-1-2">
				<h4>Bodyweight Pros</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Great for muscular endurance</li>
					<li>Improves core strength, balance, and flexibility</li>
					<li>Less likely to sustain injury from improper technique</li>
					<li>Convenient: you can do them anywhere</li>
					<li>Time efficient: no waiting for equipment</li>
					<li>Affordable: no gym membership required</li>
					<li>Private: no pervy gym rats hitting on you</li>
			</section><!--
			--><section class="col-1-2">
				<h4>Bodyweight Cons</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Hard to increase resistance to muscles</li>
					<li>Not the best for muscle-strength training</li>
					<li>Miss out on several powerful muscle-building exercises:
					heavy squats, deadlifts, and bench and military press</li>
			</section><!--
			--><section class="col-1-2">
				<h4>Weight Pros</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Easy to increase resistance to muscles</li>
					<li>Clear and easy way to track progress (more weight
					= progress)</li>
					<li>Best way to increase muscle strength, size, and mass</li>
					<li>Improve bone density and tendon strength</li>
					<li>More muscle burns more fat</li>
					<li>Great for strenghthening muscular imbalances</li>
			</section><!--
			--><section class="col-1-2">
				<h4>Weight Cons</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Higher chance of injury due to improper form</li>
					<li>Cost: most often requires a gym membership</li>
					<li>Time: traveling to/from gym, waiting for machines/weights</li>
					<li>Could lead to muscle tightness, inflexibility, and poor 
					posture</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			
			<p>If you're looking to increase muscle strength and size, then
			training with weights is probably your best best. If you want to
			improve the strength of your core and improve your balance by
			moving your body through space, nothing beats bodyweight training.</p>
			
			<h3>Why You Should Do Bodyweight Training</h3>
			<p>Bodyweight training increases muscular strength and endurance
			while improving balance and flexibility. It's time and cost
			efficient and can be done anywhere at any time. These exercises
			build a stronger core which is beneficial for better overall
			health and well-being.</p>
